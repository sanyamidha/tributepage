            <h1 class="title">The Life Of Irrfan</h1>  
            <p> 1967: A Star is born </p>
            <p>Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan (7 January 1967 – 29 April 2020), known professionally as Irrfan Khan or simply Irrfan, was an Indian actor who worked in Hindi cinema as well as in British and American films. Cited in the media as one of the finest actors in Indian cinema,Khan's career spanned over 30 years and earned him numerous accolades, including a National Film Award, an Asian Film Award, and four Filmfare Awards.</p> 
            <p>In 2011, he was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour
            Khan was offered a minor role in Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay!, soon after his graduation from NSD in 1987; his scenes did not make it to the final cut. He played Lenin in a teleplay on Doordarshan titled Laal Ghaas Par Neele Ghode, based on a translation by Uday Prakash of a Russian play by Mikhail Shatrov. He was then cast as a psycho killer, the main antagonist of the show, in the serial Darr.
            Despite his success in Bollywood, he continued to work on television. He anchored Mano Ya Na Mano (airing on STAR One), and hosted Kyaa Kahein.</p>
           <p> Khan played a police inspector in the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire, for which he and the cast of the movie won Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.
            In 23 February 1995, Khan married writer and fellow NSD graduate Sutapa Sikdar. It was a love marriage. They had two sons.</p>
            <p>In 2012, he changed his first name from "Irfan" to "Irrfan"; he said he liked the sound of the extra "r" in his name. He later dropped "Khan" from his name because—according to a 2016 interview—he wanted his work to define him, not his lineage
            In March 2018, Khan revealed via a tweet that he had been diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor. He sought treatment in UK for a year and returned India in February 2019.
            He was admitted to Mumbai's Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital on 28 April 2020, where he started receiving treatment for a colon infection. Khan died the following day from the infection.His mother Saeda Begum, aged 93, had died just four days prior in Jaipur.
            Bollywood personalities paid tributes online upon the news of his death.</p>
